## How to play

This version of Minesweeper works the same way that the original game did. The game consists of a grid of bombs and safe spots. The goal is to flag all of the bombs and uncover all of the safe places. Players can uncover a square using left click, and flag a square using right click. The trick to finding the bombs is that when a safe spot is uncovered, it will have a number indicating how many surrounding locations (orthogonally and diagonally) contain a bomb.
