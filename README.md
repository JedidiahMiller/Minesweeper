# Minesweeper
Basic Minesweeper game

This project was heavily inspired by Google's version of minesweeper. After a bit of looking, Google's version was the only version that improved upon the origional version of the game. Other online Minesweeper games all had the origional, outdated look, while Google's version looked much better and included improved graphics and effects.
